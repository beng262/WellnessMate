**WellnessMate**

Welcome to WellnessMate! This is a personal, passion project, created from scratch including all sprites and animations.

## 🚀 Overview
WellnessMate is a gamified task management and wellness-tracking app built with **Flutter** for the frontend and **Firebase** (Auth, Firestore) on the backend. It features a virtual axolotl companion (“Axo”) that grows and changes based on your daily goal completion, making productivity fun and motivating.
